Dear Hiring Manager:
I'm writing to express my interest in the GIS Analyst/Programmer position.
I have 15+ yearsâ€™ experience implementing software solutions in a variety of industries; ranging from oil field services, to commercial and government contracting. Several projects I have worked on include GIS components that utilize the Google Maps API as well as a custom C# service to convert shape files into other file formats. I am skilled in the latest Agile practices and Software Development Life Cycle processes. I believe my extensive experience in planning, managing and supporting software makes me ideally qualified for this role.
I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my experience and how I might become a beneficial member of your team.
Thank you for your consideration.
Sincerely,	
Paul Dicang
